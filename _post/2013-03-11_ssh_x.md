Working example of Xnest and SSH from a VM.  

`ssh -X` on to the host.  
First install _Xnest_ and a destop manager _lubuntu-desktop_.  
_lubuntu-core_ might be sufficient, need to check.  

Make a file, in this example, called _.xinitnest_ with the contents:  

```#!/bin/sh```  
```exec /usr/bin/lxsession -s Lubuntu -e LXDE```  
Then run:  
```xinit ~/.xinitnest -- `which Xnest` :5 -geometry 1024x768```  
To test it.  

This can be run as a one liner as:  
``` ssh $HOST -X "xinit ~/.xinitnest -- \`which Xnest\` :5 -geometry 1024x768"```
\# :5 is arbitary, so is the geometry.  

Reference material:  
The Gentoo wiki had [this](http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/Xnest) and I also found [this](http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/double-x.html). Which is more focused on getting multiple X sessions running.
