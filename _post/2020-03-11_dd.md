Using `dd` and `gzip` to create and restore disk images

First order of business with `dd` is to work out which device you are targeting
`lsblk -a | grep -v loop` shows disks and partitions

If you need to check what the partitions are `sudo fdisk -l  /dev/YOURDEVICE`

To copy the disk `sudo dd status=progress bs=4M if=/dev/YOURDEVICE | gzip -c7 YOURIMAGENAME.img.gz`

To generate a checksum from the disk `sudo sha1sum /dev/YOURDEVICE`

To generate a checksum from the image `zcat YOURIMAGENAME.img.gz | sha1sum -`

To write out the disk image `zcat YOURIMAGENAME.img.gz | sudo dd status=progress bs=4M of=/dev/YOURDEVICE`

# List disks
`lsblk -io kname,size` disks and partitions  
`lsblk -ido name,size` just disks/loops

# dd skipping disk errors
Add `conv=noerror` to the command for disks that are producing read errors

# What I'm using this for
I'm cloning test instruments disks, these are sparsely used disks  
Around 6GB used on a 80GB disk, gzips to around 5GB

# Why dd & gzip
`dd` and `gzip` are standard in `nix OSes so a live Linux distro can be used for this task
