# Virtual Machine Host
Using [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Project_Wiki) Linux  as a VM host and [Cockpit Project](https://cockpit-project.org/) to manage the host.


## Sources
### Fedora
[Get Fedora](https://getfedora.org) Server edition  

### Windows
Obtain a Windows ISO by running the [Create Windows 10 installation media](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10) tool from Microsoft

### Virtio
Obtain the Virtio ISO (Virtual IO drivers for Windows) from [Fedora](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/latest-virtio/)
â€ƒ

## Installation Process
- Install on a machine
- Follow prompts to install
- Reboot
- Login

``` bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install libvirt cockpit cockpit-machines

# Enable the services
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd --now
sudo systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now

# Not on by default on workstation
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=cockpit --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
 
ip a  # Get the IP address
```
## Cockpit
Connect the Cockpit interface on this machine from a web browser at its IP address on port 9090

- Go to the **Networking** tab 
- Click **Add Bridge**
  - Create **bridge0**
  - With ports **~eth0**

Machine may obtain different IP address after creating bridge  
Reconnect as needed

Load install media to somewhere accessible to libvirt

## Installation of Windows 10 in a VM
- Go to the **Virtual Machines** tab and click **Create VM**
- Installation type **Local install media**
- Installation source **/var/lib/libvirt/images/*.iso**
- Operating System **Microsoft Windows**
- Allocate storage and memory
  - This can be extended later
- Deselect **immediately start VM**
- Click **Create**
- Click on the created VM name
- In the **Disks** section:
  - Edit the **device** disk to bus **virtio** and press **Save**
  - Click **Add Disk**
  - Use **existing** and select Volume **virtio-win.iso**
  - Set bus to **SATA**
  - Press **Add**
- In the **Network** section:
  - Change the interface type to **bridge to LAN**
  - bridge to **bridge0**
  - model to **e1000e**
- Click **Install**

## During installation of Windows 10
Windows 10 needs to load a driver to access virtio storage

At the point it is needed click to **Manually install a driver**

From the virtio ISO select the **E:\viostor\w10\amd64** directory
The driver should be loaded and storage will become available 
Proceed to install normally

### After the installation 
With Windows running navigate to the virtio ISO and run the installer to get the drivers for network and memory management drivers

- Go to the **Virtual Machines** tab click on the created VM name
- In the **Network** section
  - Change the interface model to **virtio**
- In the **Disks** section
  - Remove **VirtIO.iso** and **Windows10_????.iso**

After rebooting the VM networking will be easier for the VM and host to process
